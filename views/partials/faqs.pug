    +accordionItem("How do I sign-up to participate?")
        ul
            li Go to www.smokinwithsmithfield.com and complete the registration form. The registration form should be completed by the head cook (primary pit master) who will be the point of contact throughout the competition year. 
            li If you are signing up to be a 2019 Smithfield Committed Cook, you can opt-in to the Smokin’ With Smithfield National Barbecue Championship at that time.  You do not need to complete a separate registration for the Championship.
    +accordionItem("Is there a cost?")
        p It’s free to register your team in the yearlong Points Chase.  Should you earn a chance to compete in the top 24 at the Playoffs, you would be responsible for your travel and accommodations to and from the competition.
    +accordionItem("Why should I sign up?  You are showing me my ranking without sign up.")
        p Yes, everyone can view their position in the Leaderboard starting January 2019, but only those who are registered and the chance to compete in the Playoffs.  You must be registered by July 1, 2019 to be eligible to participate in the Playoffs.
    +accordionItem("How do I know how I’m doing?")
        p Beginning in January 2019, you can come back to www.smokinwithsmithfield.com to see the leaderboard that ranks all teams across the country.
    +accordionItem("I don’t cook very often, does the competition still apply to me?")
        p Of course! This points structure takes into consideration your team’s top 12 competition scores.  So even those teams who cook less than 12 competitions per year can participate, they’ll just have less scores to average from.
    +accordionItem("When and where are the Playoffs?")
        p The Playoffs will take place in New Orleans, LA November 14 – November 17, 2019. The top 24 eligible teams from across the country who registered for the Points Chase are invited to participate. How will the Playoffs work?

                    li Round 3: 6 teams will be narrowed down to 1 National Champion.
    +accordionItem("Can team members compete on multiple teams?")
        p No. Team members may compete on only one registered team at a time.
